title = {Language Diversity across the Consonant Inventories: A Study in the  Framework of Complex Networks},
abstract = { n this paper, we attempt to explain the emergence of the linguistic diversity that exists across the consonant inventories of some of the major language families of the world through a complex network based growth model. There is only a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small amount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth process. The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of consonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than it is across the families. The implications of this result are twofold - (a) there is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain linguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger preferential connection between the languages within a family than across them. Furthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a correlation with the period of existence of the language families under investigation. },

title = {Statistical physics of social dynamics},
abstract = { Statistical physics has proven to be a very fruitful framework to describe phenomena outside the realm of traditional physics. The last years have witnessed the attempt by physicists to study collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of individuals as elementary units in social structures. Here we review the state of the art by focusing on three major research lines i.e., opinion, cultural and language dynamics. In addition we discuss other social phenomena, such as crowd behavior, hierarchy formation, human dynamics, social spreading. We highlight the connections between these problems and other, more traditional, topics of statistical physics. We also emphasize the comparison of model results with empirical data from social systems. },

title = {Size dependent word frequencies and translational invariance of books},
abstract = { It is shown that a real novel shares many characteristic features with a null model in which the words are randomly distributed throughout the text. Such a common feature is a certain translational invariance of the text. Another is that the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends on the length of the text in the same way as the null model. This means that an approximate power-law tail ascribed to the data will have an exponent which changes with the size of the text-section which is analyzed. A further consequence is that a novel cannot be described by text-evolution models like the Simon model. The size-transformation of a novel is found to be well described by a specific Random Book Transformation. This size transformation in addition enables a more precise determination of the functional form of the word-frequency distribution. The implications of the results are discussed. },

title = {Entropy and Long range correlations in literary English},
abstract = { Recently long range correlations were detected in nucleotide sequences and in human writings by several authors. We undertake here a systematic investigation of two books, Moby Dick by H. Melville and Grimm's tales, with respect to the existence of long range correlations. The analysis is based on the calculation of entropy like quantities as the mutual information for pairs of letters and the entropy, the mean uncertainty, per letter. We further estimate the number of different subwords of a given length {\$}n{\$}. Filtering out the contributions due to the effects of the finite length of the texts, we find correlations ranging to a few hundred letters. Scaling laws for the mutual information (decay with a power law), for the entropy per letter (decay with the inverse square root of {\$}n{\$}) and for the word numbers (stretched exponential growth with {\$}n{\$} and with a power law of the text length) were found. },

title = {Generic modes of consensus formation in stochastic language dynamics},
abstract = { We introduce a class of stochastic models for the dynamics of two linguistic variants that are competing to become the single, shared convention within an unstructured community of speakers. Different instances of the model are distinguished by the way agents handle variability in the language (i.e., multiple forms for the same meaning). The class of models includes as special cases two previously-studied models of language dynamics, the Naming Game, in which agents tend to standardise on variants they have encountered most frequently, and the Utterance Selection Model, in which agents tend to preserve variability by uniform sampling of a pool of utterances. We reduce the full complexities of the dynamics to a single-coordinate stochastic model which allows the probability and time taken for speakers to reach consensus on a single variant to be calculated for large communities. This analysis suggests that in the broad class of models considered, consensus is formed in one of three generic ways, according to whether agents tend to eliminate, accentuate or sample neutrally the variability in the language. These different regimes are observed in simulations of the full dynamics, and for which the simplified model in some cases makes good quantitative predictions. We use these results, along with comparisons with related models, to conjecture the likely behaviour of more general models, and further make use of empirical data to argue that in reality, biases away from neutral sampling behaviour are likely to be small. },

title = {Towards the quantification of the semantic information encoded in  written language},
abstract = { Written language is a complex communication signal capable of conveying information encoded in the form of ordered sequences of words. Beyond the local order ruled by grammar, semantic and thematic structures affect long-range patterns in word usage. Here, we show that a direct application of information theory quantifies the relationship between the statistical distribution of words and the semantic content of the text. We show that there is a characteristic scale, roughly around a few thousand words, which establishes the typical size of the most informative segments in written language. Moreover, we find that the words whose contributions to the overall information is larger, are the ones more closely associated with the main subjects and topics of the text. This scenario can be explained by a model of word usage that assumes that words are distributed along the text in domains of a characteristic size where their frequency is higher than elsewhere. Our conclusions are based on the analysis of a large database of written language, diverse in subjects and styles, and thus are likely to be applicable to general language sequences encoding complex information. },

title = {Equilibrium (Zipf) and Dynamic (Grasseberg-Procaccia) method based  analyses of human texts. A comparison of natural (english) and artificial  (esperanto) languages},
abstract = { A comparison of two english texts from Lewis Carroll, one (Alice in wonderland), also translated into esperanto, the other (Through a looking glass) are discussed in order to observe whether natural and artificial languages significantly differ from each other. One dimensional time series like signals are constructed using only word frequencies (FTS) or word lengths (LTS). The data is studied through (i) a Zipf method for sorting out correlations in the FTS and (ii) a Grassberger-Procaccia (GP) technique based method for finding correlations in LTS. Features are compared : different power laws are observed with characteristic exponents for the ranking properties, and the {\it phase space attractor dimensionality}. The Zipf exponent can take values much less than unity ({\$}ca.{\$} 0.50 or 0.30) depending on how a sentence is defined. This non-universality is conjectured to be a measure of the author {\$}style{\$}. Moreover the attractor dimension {\$}r{\$} is a simple function of the so called phase space dimension {\$}n{\$}, i.e., {\$}r = n^{\lambda}{\$}, with {\$}\lambda = 0.79{\$}. Such an exponent should also conjecture to be a measure of the author {\$}creativity{\$}. However, even though there are quantitative differences between the original english text and its esperanto translation, the qualitative differences are very minutes, indicating in this case a translation relatively well respecting, along our analysis lines, the content of the author writing. },

abstract = { Evidence is given for a systematic text-length dependence of the power-law index gamma of a single book. The estimated gamma values are consistent with a monotonic decrease from 2 to 1 with increasing length of a text. A direct connection to an extended Heap's law is explored. The infinite book limit is, as a consequence, proposed to be given by gamma = 1 instead of the value gamma=2 expected if the Zipf's law was ubiquitously applicable. In addition we explore the idea that the systematic text-length dependence can be described by a meta book concept, which is an abstract representation reflecting the word-frequency structure of a text. According to this concept the word-frequency distribution of a text, with a certain length written by a single author, has the same characteristics as a text of the same length pulled out from an imaginary complete infinite corpus written by the same author. },

abstract = { We analyze here a particular kind of linguistic network where vertices representwords and edges stand for syntactic relationships between words. The statisticalproperties of these networks have been recently studied and various features such as the small-world phenomenon and a scale-free distribution of degrees have been found. Our work focuses on four classes of words: verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives. Here, we use spectral methods sorting vertices. We show that the ordering clusters words of the same class. For nouns and verbs, the cluster size distribution clearly follows a power-law distribution that cannot be explained by a null hypothesis. Long-range correlations are found between vertices in theordering provided by the spectral method. The findings support the use of spectral methods for detecting community structure. },

title = {Hierarchical structures induce long-range dynamical correlations in written texts},
abstract = {Thoughts and ideas are multidimensional and often concurrent, yet they can be expressed surprisingly well sequentially by the translation into language. This reduction of dimensions occurs naturally but requires memory and necessitates the existence of correlations, e.g., in written text. However, correlations in word appearance decay quickly, while previous observations of long-range correlations using random walk approaches yield little insight on memory or on semantic context. Instead, we study combinations of words that a reader is exposed to within a "window of attention" spanning about 100 words. We define a vector space of such word combinations by looking at words that co-occur within the window of attention, and analyze its structure. Singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix identifies a basis whose vectors correspond to specific topics, or "concepts" that are relevant to the text. As the reader follows a text, the "vector of attention" traces out a trajectory of directions in this "concept space." We find that memory of the direction is retained over long times, forming power-law correlations. The appearance of power laws hints at the existence of an underlying hierarchical network. Indeed, imposing a hierarchy similar to that defined by volumes, chapters, paragraphs, etc. succeeds in creating correlations in a surrogate random text that are identical to those of the original text. We conclude that hierarchical structures in text serve to create long-range correlations, and use the reader's memory in reenacting some of the multidimensionality of the thoughts being expressed.},

title = {Quantifying the evolutionary dynamics of language},
abstract = {Human language is based on grammatical rules(1-4). Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time(5). Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English's proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, '-ed', to signify past tense(6). Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.},

title = {Universal Complex Structures in Written Language},
abstract = { Quantitative linguistics has provided us with a number of empirical laws that characterise the evolution of languages and competition amongst them. In terms of language usage, one of the most influential results is Zipf's law of word frequencies. Zipf's law appears to be universal, and may not even be unique to human language. However, there is ongoing controversy over whether Zipf's law is a good indicator of complexity. Here we present an alternative approach that puts Zipf's law in the context of critical phenomena (the cornerstone of complexity in physics) and establishes the presence of a large scale "attraction" between successive repetitions of words. Moreover, this phenomenon is scale-invariant and universal - the pattern is independent of word frequency and is observed in texts by different authors and written in different languages. There is evidence, however, that the shape of the scaling relation changes for words that play a key role in the text, implying the existence of different "universality classes" in the repetition of words. These behaviours exhibit striking parallels with complex catastrophic phenomena. },

title = {Consensus and ordering in language dynamics},
abstract = { We consider two social consensus models, the AB-model and the Naming Game restricted to two conventions, which describe a population of interacting agents that can be in either of two equivalent states (A or B) or in a third mixed (AB) state. Proposed in the context of language competition and emergence, the AB state was associated with bilingualism and synonymy respectively. We show that the two models are equivalent in the mean field approximation, though the differences at the microscopic level have non-trivial consequences. To point them out, we investigate an extension of these dynamics in which confidence/trust is considered, focusing on the case of an underlying fully connected graph, and we show that the consensus-polarization phase transition taking place in the Naming Game is not observed in the AB model. We then consider the interface motion in regular lattices. Qualitatively, both models show the same behavior: a diffusive interface motion in a one-dimensional lattice, and a curvature driven dynamics with diffusing stripe-like metastable states in a two-dimensional one. However, in comparison to the Naming Game, the AB-model dynamics is shown to slow down the diffusion of such configurations. },

title = {Least effort and the origins of scaling in human language},
abstract = {The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal-object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.},

title = {A Random Matrix Approach to Language Acquisition},
abstract = { Since language is tied to cognition, we expect the linguistic structures to reflect patterns we encounter in nature and analyzed by physics. Within this realm we investigate the process of protolanguage acquisition, using analytical and tractable methods developed within physics. A protolanguage is a mapping between sounds and objects (or concepts) of the perceived world. This mapping is represented by a matrix and the linguistic interaction among individuals is described by a random matrix model. There are two essential parameters in our approach. The strength of the linguistic interaction {\$}\beta{\$}, which following Chomsky's tradition, we consider as a genetically determined ability, and the number {\$}N{\$} of employed sounds (the lexicon size). Our model of linguistic interaction is analytically studied using methods of statistical physics and simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis reveals an intricate relationship between the innate propensity for language acquisition {\$}\beta{\$} and the lexicon size {\$}N{\$}, {\$}N \sim \exp(\beta){\$}. Thus a small increase of the genetically determined {\$}\beta{\$} may lead to an incredible lexical explosion. Our approximate scheme offers an explanation for the biological affinity of different species and their simultaneous linguistic disparity. },

abstract = { Following an early claim by Nelson {\&} McEvoy \cite{Nelson:McEvoy:2007} suggesting that word associations can display `spooky action at a distance behaviour', a serious investigation of the potentially quantum nature of such associations is currently underway. This paper presents a simple quantum model of a word association system. It is shown that a quantum model of word entanglement can recover aspects of both the Spreading Activation equation and the Spooky-activation-at-a-distance equation, both of which are used to model the activation level of words in human memory. },

title = {Patterns in syntactic dependency networks},
abstract = {Many languages are spoken on Earth. Despite their diversity, many robust language universals are known to exist. All languages share syntax, i.e., the ability of combining words for forming sentences. The origin of such traits is an issue of open debate. By using recent developments from the statistical physics of complex networks, we show that different syntactic dependency networks (from Czech, German, and Romanian) share many nontrivial statistical patterns such as the small world phenomenon, scaling in the distribution of degrees, and disassortative mixing. Such previously unreported features of syntax organization are not a trivial consequence of the structure of sentences, but an emergent trait at the global scale.},

abstract = { In this work, we suggest a parameterized statistical model (the gamma distribution) for the frequency of word occurrences in long strings of English text and use this model to build a corresponding thermodynamic picture by constructing the partition function. We then use our partition function to compute thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy and the specific heat. In this approach, the parameters of the word frequency model vary from word to word so that each word has a different corresponding thermodynamics and we suggest that differences in the specific heat reflect differences in how the words are used in language, differentiating keywords from common and function words. Finally, we apply our thermodynamic picture to the problem of retrieval of texts based on keywords and suggest some advantages over traditional information retrieval methods. },

title = {The small world of human language},
abstract = {Words in human language interact in sentences in non-random ways, and allow humans to construct an astronomic variety of sentences from a limited number of discrete units. This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximate to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

These languages differed widely in their history and linguistic structure, but commonalities in the network characteristics were observed. These networks were also found to be different from other networks studied in the literature. The properties of these networks suggest explanations for various aspects of linguistic processing and hint at deeper organization within human language. },

title = {Beyond Zipf's law: Modeling the structure of human language},
abstract = { Human language, the most powerful communication system in history, is closely associated with cognition. Written text is one of the fundamental manifestations of language, and the study of its universal regularities can give clues about how our brains process information and how we, as a society, organize and share it. Still, only classical patterns such as Zipf's law have been explored in depth. In contrast, other basic properties like the existence of bursts of rare words in specific documents, the topical organization of collections, or the sublinear growth of vocabulary size with the length of a document, have only been studied one by one and mainly applying heuristic methodologies rather than basic principles and general mechanisms. As a consequence, there is a lack of understanding of linguistic processes as complex emergent phenomena. Beyond Zipf's law for word frequencies, here we focus on Heaps' law, burstiness, and the topicality of document collections, which encode correlations within and across documents absent in random null models. We introduce and validate a generative model that explains the simultaneous emergence of all these patterns from simple rules. As a result, we find a connection between the bursty nature of rare words and the topical organization of texts and identify dynamic word ranking and memory across documents as key mechanisms explaining the non trivial organization of written text. Our research can have broad implications and practical applications in computer science, cognitive science, and linguistics. },
